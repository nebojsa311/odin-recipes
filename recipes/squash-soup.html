    <h1>Chef John's Roasted Butternut Squash Soup</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients for the soup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced carrots</li>
        <li>6 whole garlic cloves, peeled</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound butternut squash, halved lengthwise and seeded</li>
        <li>6 cups chicken broth, plus more if needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons marple syrup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup creme fraiche</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sage brown butter</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>6 large sage leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

        </li>
        <li>Start the soup: Drizzle olive oil into large roasting pan. Add onion, carrots, garlic cloves, and a big
            pinch of salt; toss until vegetables are coated in oil. Place squash halves onto the chopped vegetables with
            the cut sides facing up. Sprinkle squash with additional salt.

        </li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until squash is tender and easily pierced with the tip of a knife, about 1 hour.
            Remove from the oven and allow vegetables to cool a bit.</li>
        <li>While the vegetables are cooling, make the brown butter: Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. When
            butter foams and starts to turn golden brown, reduce the heat to low. When butter turns from golden to a
            light, nutty brown, remove from the heat and immediately stir in sage leaves.</li>
        <li>Finish the soup: Scoop out squash flesh and place into a large stockpot with remaining roasted vegetables.
            Stir in chicken broth, brown butter mixture, and maple syrup. Place the pot over high heat and bring to a
            simmer. Reduce the heat to low and slowly simmer to blend flavors, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove from the heat.
        </li>
        <li>Blend with an immersion blender until very smooth, 3 to 4 minutes. Pass mixture through a strainer to remove
            any remaining fibrous bits.

        </li>
        <li>If soup seems too thick, add a few tablespoons of water or chicken broth. Stir in cider vinegar, a pinch of
            salt if needed, and cayenne pepper. Garnish each serving with a dollop of crème fraîche and chopped chives.
        </li>
    </ol>
